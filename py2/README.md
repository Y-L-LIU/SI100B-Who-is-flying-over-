It's very important to know the difference between fork and branch.

Fork means a completely now repo.

Branch means you develop your part in the same repo. 

Furthermore, there are a variety of functions accessible if and only if through using branch.

If you want to learn more, search for more information on the Internet.

**To get started**:

<code>
git clone ...
</code>
<br>

<code>
git checkout "your own branch's name"
</code>
(I have created for you, like ylliu\ydqiu\htwei)

**To commit:**

If you have finished the part belongs to you, when committing to your own repo. 

**please give detailed message concluding the specific functions you edited in order to make the command<code>git reflog</code>easier to use**

**To Push**:

It is not necessary to give a tag.

<code>git push origin (your branch)</code>

**Remember not to create files with the same name in branch:master**<br>
**Remember to push your code to your own branch not the master**
